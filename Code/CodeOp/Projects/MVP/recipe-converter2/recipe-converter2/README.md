# How to use Recipe Converter App

### `Navigate to app using the following URL`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `Add recipe title and target number of servings`

Input the recipe title and how many servings it originally makes. Enter the number of servings you intend to scale the recipe to. This number is your scaling factor and can be anything greater or equal to 1.

### `Enter ingredients into the form`

Add ingredient name, quantity, and choose from the pick list a unit of measurement (note: only Imperial for now). If you wish to add additional ingredients, press the Add Ingredients button at the bottom. Any ingredients that you wish to remove, you can press the X button to the right of the ingredient fields.

### `Convert recipe`

Once you have entered all of the ingredients, quantities, and units necessary, press the Convert Recipe button at the bottom of the page. This will pull up the converted recipe display, where you can view all of the scaled ingredients for your recipe. Happy cooking!
